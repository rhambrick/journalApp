# journalApp
The goal is to create an app that is simple but also useful to me and others. The idea is a journal app where users can take notes. They can perform all the CRUD operations as needed (create, read, update, delete) for me to obtain some experience with modern databases and scalability. I personally would like to encrypt the notes as well, having each username tied to an encryption key of sorts, helping the app be secure (notes are stored encrypted and only locally decrypted).

This is not a new or novel idea, and it's probably not hard, but as an electrical engineer, I don't dabble in high level software like this a lot (I am a 1's and 0's type of person), so this may be good experience for me on the pure software side of the field. I prefer back end work over front end, but this may end up requiring some front end stuff to be presentable. A good "full stack" intro project.

Oh, this needs to be free to make and free to use too.

## Desired functions:
- Sign up / Log in
- Create a note
- View all notes
- Edit a note
- Delete a note
- Notes are encrypted before leaving the browser
